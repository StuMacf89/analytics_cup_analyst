# SkillCorner X PySport Analytics Cup - Stuart Macfarlane - Analyst Track

This main. branch of the repositorty does contain a small sample of data extracted from my full full dataset which is fully download from the SkillCorner x PySport public repository. This samnple is only used to speed up loading and processing for the Streamlit web application as loading, processing, computing and visualising was too computationally expensive during user interaction with the app.
